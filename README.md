# Welcome to Your Kliv Project

## Getting Started with Your Code

We've made it easy to work on your project however you prefer. Kliv provides a full IDE experience right in your browser, but you also have this repository as your personal backup copy of the source code.

### Option 1: Use Kliv's Full IDE (Recommended)
Visit [kliv.dev](https://kliv.dev) to access your complete development environment. Kliv provides a full-featured IDE where you can:
- Edit your code directly with syntax highlighting and autocomplete
- Use AI prompts to help you build features
- See live previews of your changes
- Debug and test your application

Best of all, any changes you make are automatically saved to this repository, giving you a complete backup of your work.

### Option 2: Work Locally with Your Own IDE
Having this repository means you always have access to your source code. If you ever need to work offline or prefer using your local development tools, simply clone this repo and you're good to go. Everything stays perfectly synchronized with Kliv.

**Prerequisites:** You'll need Node.js and npm installed. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) for easy installation.

```sh
# 1. Clone your repository
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# 2. Navigate to your project
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# 3. Install dependencies
npm install

# 4. Start developing
npm run dev
```
